\section{mules}
MUltiple LEaf Separation\newline
Quick and easy ImageJ macro for distinguishing multiple leaves in one image and finding the LAR of each leaf. \newline

\textbf{As with all image analysis projects, be sure to have a backup of your original images before starting!!}

\subsection{Workflow:}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Download mules.ijm
  \item Open ImageJ/ FIJI
  \item Navigate to Plugins > Macros > Edit...

        \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{/home/cb/bioprogs/projects/fieldDIA/docs/demo_imgs/mules-01.png}%
        \medskip
      \end{minipage}
      
  \item Open the mules.ijm file (most likely in your /Downloads folder) and a box containing the macro will appear

        \medskip
      \end{minipage}
  
  \item \underline{Do NOT open any images}- this macro works through the given folder and does not need a starting image. You should only have the macro window open at this time.
  
  \pagebreak
  
  \item Click "Run" on the box with the mules.ijm file and select the folder containing the images you want processed as well as where you would like the outputs to go.

        \medskip
        \end{minipage}
      
  \item You should see the screen flash a lot as the images gets processed. Your original image will close and a few output boxes will remain.

        \medskip
      \end{minipage}
  
  \pagebreak
  
  \item Check your folder containing the original image. You should see several new files that are split from the original.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Output:}

The \underline{".csv" file} will contain the coordinates and length of Feret's diameter (FeretX/Y & Feret) and breadth (BrdthX/Y & Breadth).\newline
  
The file retaining the {"<original name>.png"} will have a drawing to illustrate what was detected from the particle analysis, with leaf numbers corresponding to the item number in the \underline{".csv" file}.\newline
  
Files ending with \underline{"_no#.png"} will be individual leaf images. These numbered images will match with whatever leaf number is shown in the drawing image.\newline


NOTE: Individual leaf images are cropped pretty close by the program, but there shouldn't be any loss of total leaf area per image.
