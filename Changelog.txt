MuLES changelog

#--------------- Changes ---------------#
added    2021-07-03	parameter for single vs multiple leaf analysis
removed  2021-07-03	redundant measurments from default "Analyze particles..."
added    2021-07-04	dependencies check
changed  2021-07-05	how single vs multiple leaves are handled during the LAR measurement step
added    2021-07-05	cleaned up step to eliminate background noise in 'single leaf' images
fixed    2021-08-04	small leaves were not picked up; reduced surface area requirement for detection 
fixed    2021-08-04	no measurements in output when "Measurements" or "Both" selected
fixed    2021-08-04	irregular watershed was not being applied to images containing multiple leaves
fixed    2021-08-06	full image for detected leaves came out too dim to use
fixed    2021-08-06	"Labels" in Results should now be named after their respective leaves
added    2021-08-09	option for .jpg or .png output images
added    2021-10-15	"advanced options" section; red & blue lines for F.diam & breadth
added    2021-10-16	"advanced options" section; pick up small leaves (area = 1000px)
changed  2021-11-15	method for drawing breadth; clarification for how breadth is actually measured
fixed    2021-11-16	colors should be fixed now for line drawing
added    2021-11-16	"advanced options" section; swap between white/black and black/white 
added    2021-11-16	leading zeros for output files
added    2021-11-19	"advanced options" section; small or detailed results option
added    2021-12-03	single line measurement between breadth points (for offset)
changed  2021-12-03	individual colors for PrLen1/2
added    2022-01-25	filter based on stdDev of AspRatio; **only works with EACH image- cannot use with 1 genotype spread over multiple images
removed  2022-03-06	detailed csv option; can be revisited
added    2022-03-06	troubleshooting method for detecting single leaves
changed  2022-05-26	wording for GUI
changed	 2022-05-26	now saves full picture with labels
added	 2022-05-26	"outlier" tag to filenames
 
#--------------- Issues ---------------#
Non-leaf objects being recognized based on surface area
 	> adds additional measurements to the output
 	>> some foreign objects still fall within cutoff range of stdDev filter
 	>>> need secondary filter based on Area values (can be tricky with small leaves)
 
 watershed separator value 0-100 for overlap/ touch; value 0-250 for normal
 
 "outlier" filename tags not available for "Masks only" option
 
#--------------- Planned ---------------#
Renaming for output (user-specs, leading zeros, ...)
Petiole Isolation/ crop
R workflow integration
Elliptic Fourier Descriptors
PCA, Umap(?)
degree of offset for 'FBrdth'
parameters as % of image pixel dimensions
